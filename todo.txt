Known bugs
* the width of the customer key in the list of documents: If its huge then comedy ensues


Known 'poorly implemented':
The PDF stuff: 
* the PDF facts shouldn't be editable in the EditSchema, they should be on the PDF section. And should do the 'pull in extra fields' as well (possibly optionally)
* Issue document

Basic Stuff
* Paging and Find
* Having the schemas part of the Group Card at all
* Deleted schemas and groups
* and what does it mean to have deleted stuff..

Experimental Features
* Import From PDFs experimental feature is very cool, but needs a status 'this is what I did' and a 'I did it' flash
* The camera is awesome. Link to issuing documents. Sort out the life cycle of the image. Compress the image. etc
* Aspect ratio
* The 'kyc stuff' should probably be nuked and redone 

Dog fooding results
* We need a reissue button: takes you to the issue with the data populated (wait for document issue refactor, as hard to do right now)
* Need 'view documents' and/or 'issue document' when viewing a document


Desired new guis:
"Issue/Edit Schema" major edit
"Issue/Edit Document" major edit


Learning from the SYCU/DC day
1: It's quite hard to position the QR code on the PDF
2: We !really! need reissue capability
3: Volatile data flag needed (date for example is expected to change)
4: When we email PDFs etc, need to give them sensible names
5: Would quite like 'send me the PDFs of these people'
6: We crashed at least twice with OOM requests. Once when parsing group data.
7: It was hard to do the label printing

BUT: Mostly it worked. The 'spin document' feature (soon to be part of the 'supporting documentation') was awesome
